# MCP Server

This README was created using the C# MCP server project template.
It demonstrates how you can easily create an MCP server using C# and run it as an ASP.NET Core web application.

The MCP server is built as a self-contained application and does not require the .NET runtime to be installed on the target machine.
However, since it is self-contained, it must be built for each target platform separately.
By default, the template is configured to build for:
* `win-x64`
* `win-arm64`
* `osx-arm64`
* `linux-x64`
* `linux-arm64`
* `linux-musl-x64`

If your require more platforms to be supported, update the list of runtime identifiers in the project's `<RuntimeIdentifiers />` element.

Please note that this template is currently in an early preview stage. If you have feedback, please take a [brief survey](http://aka.ms/dotnet-mcp-template-survey).

## Developing locally

To test this MCP server from source code (locally), you can configure your IDE to connect to the server using localhost.

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "mcpserver": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:9996"
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing the MCP Server

Once configured, you can ask Copilot Chat for a random number, for example, `Give me 3 random numbers`. It should prompt you to use the `get_random_number` tool on the `mcpserver` MCP server and show you the results.

## More information

ASP.NET Core MCP servers use the [ModelContextProtocol.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ModelContextProtocol.AspNetCore) package from the MCP C# SDK. For more information about MCP:
