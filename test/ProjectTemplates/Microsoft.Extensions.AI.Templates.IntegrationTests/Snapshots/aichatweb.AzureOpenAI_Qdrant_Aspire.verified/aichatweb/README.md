# AI Chat with Custom Data

This project is an AI chat application that demonstrates how to chat with custom data using an AI language model. Please note that this template is currently in an early preview stage. If you have feedback, please take a [brief survey](https://aka.ms/dotnet-chat-templatePreview2-survey).

>[!NOTE]
> Before running this project you need to configure the API keys or endpoints for the providers you have chosen. See below for details specific to your choices.

### Known Issues

#### Errors running Ollama or Docker

A recent incompatibility was found between Ollama and Docker Desktop. This issue results in runtime errors when connecting to Ollama, and the workaround for that can lead to Docker not working for Aspire projects.

This incompatibility can be addressed by upgrading to Docker Desktop 4.41.1. See [ollama/ollama#9509](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/9509#issuecomment-2842461831) for more information and a link to install the version of Docker Desktop with the fix.

# Configure the AI Model Provider

## Using Azure Provisioning

The project is set up to automatically provision Azure resources, but local configuration is configured. For detailed instructions, see the [Local Provisioning documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire/azure/local-provisioning#configuration).

From the command line, configure local provisioning for this project using .NET User Secrets by running the following commands:

```sh
cd aichatweb.AppHost
dotnet user-secrets set Azure:SubscriptionId "<Your subscription id>"
dotnet user-secrets set Azure:AllowResourceGroupCreation "true"
dotnet user-secrets set Azure:ResourceGroup "<Valid resource group name>"
dotnet user-secrets set Azure:Location "<Valid Azure location>"
```

Make sure to replace placeholder values with real configuration values.

# Running the application

## Using Visual Studio

1. Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio.
2. Press `Ctrl+F5` or click the "Start" button in the toolbar to run the project.

## Using Visual Studio Code

1. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. Install the [C# Dev Kit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) for Visual Studio Code.
3. Once installed, Open the `Program.cs` file in the aichatweb.AppHost project.
4. Run the project by clicking the "Run" button in the Debug view.

## Trust the localhost certificate

Several .NET Aspire templates include ASP.NET Core projects that are configured to use HTTPS by default. If this is the first time you're running the project, an exception might occur when loading the Aspire dashboard. This error can be resolved by trusting the self-signed development certificate with the .NET CLI.

See [Troubleshoot untrusted localhost certificate in .NET Aspire](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire/troubleshooting/untrusted-localhost-certificate) for more information.

# Updating JavaScript dependencies

This template leverages JavaScript libraries to provide essential functionality. These libraries are located in the wwwroot/lib folder of the aichatweb.Web project. For instructions on updating each dependency, please refer to the README.md file in each respective folder.
