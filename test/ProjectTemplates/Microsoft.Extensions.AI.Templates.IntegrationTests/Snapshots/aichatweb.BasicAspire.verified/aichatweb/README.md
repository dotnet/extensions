# AI Chat with Custom Data

This project is an AI chat application that demonstrates how to chat with custom data using an AI language model. Please note that this template is currently in an early preview stage. If you have feedback, please take a [brief survey](https://aka.ms/dotnet-chat-templatePreview2-survey).

>[!NOTE]
> Before running this project you need to configure the API keys or endpoints for the providers you have chosen. See below for details specific to your choices.

# Configure the AI Model Provider

## Using GitHub Models
To use models hosted by GitHub Models, you will need to create a GitHub personal access token. The token should not have any scopes or permissions. See [Managing your personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

From the command line, configure your token for this project using .NET User Secrets by running the following commands:

```sh
cd aichatweb.AppHost
dotnet user-secrets set ConnectionStrings:openai "Endpoint=https://models.inference.ai.azure.com;Key=YOUR-API-KEY"
```

2. Press `Ctrl+F5` or click the "Start" button in the toolbar to run the project.

## Using Visual Studio Code

1. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. Install the [C# Dev Kit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) for Visual Studio Code.
3. Once installed, Open the `Program.cs` file in the aichatweb.AppHost project.
4. Run the project by clicking the "Run" button in the Debug view.

## Trust the localhost certificate

Several .NET Aspire templates include ASP.NET Core projects that are configured to use HTTPS by default. If this is the first time you're running the project, an exception might occur when loading the Aspire dashboard. This error can be resolved by trusting the self-signed development certificate with the .NET CLI.

See [Troubleshoot untrusted localhost certificate in .NET Aspire](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire/troubleshooting/untrusted-localhost-certificate) for more information.
