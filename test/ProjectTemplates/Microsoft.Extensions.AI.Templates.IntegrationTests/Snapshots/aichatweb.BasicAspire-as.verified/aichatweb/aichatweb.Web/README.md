# Configure the AI Model Provider
To use models hosted by GitHub Models, you will need to create a GitHub personal access token. The token should not have any scopes or permissions. See [Managing your personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

From the command line, configure your token for this project using .NET User Secrets by running the following commands:

```sh
cd <<your-project-directory>>
dotnet user-secrets set GitHubModels:Token YOUR-TOKEN
```
