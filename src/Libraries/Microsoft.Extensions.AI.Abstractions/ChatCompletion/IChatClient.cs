/// However, implementations of <see cref="IChatClient"/> might mutate the arguments supplied to <see cref="CompleteAsync"/> and
/// <see cref="CompleteStreamingAsync"/>, such as by adding additional messages to the messages list or configuring the options
/// instance. Thus, consumers of the interface either should avoid using shared instances of these arguments for concurrent
/// invocations or should otherwise ensure by construction that no <see cref="IChatClient"/> instances are used which might employ
/// such mutation. For example, the WithChatOptions method be provided with a callback that could mutate the supplied options
/// argument, and that should be avoided if using a singleton options instance.
