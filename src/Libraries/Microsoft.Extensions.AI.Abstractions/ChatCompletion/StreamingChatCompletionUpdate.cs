/// <summary>
/// Represents a single streaming response chunk from an <see cref="IChatClient"/>.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Conceptually, this combines the roles of <see cref="ChatCompletion"/> and <see cref="ChatMessage"/>
/// in streaming output. For ease of consumption, it also flattens the nested structure you see on
/// streaming chunks in some AI service, so instead of a dictionary of choices, each update represents a
/// single choice (and hence has its own role, choice ID, etc.).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <see cref="StreamingChatCompletionUpdate"/> is so named because it represents streaming updates
/// to a single chat completion. As such, it is considered erroneous for multiple updates that are part
/// of the same completion to contain competing values. For example, some updates that are part of
/// the same completion may have a <see langword="null"/> <see cref="StreamingChatCompletionUpdate.Role"/>
/// value, and others may have a non-<see langword="null"/> value, but all of those with a non-<see langword="null"/>
/// value must have the same value (e.g. <see cref="ChatRole.Assistant"/>. It should never be the case, for example,
/// that one <see cref="StreamingChatCompletionUpdate"/> in a completion has a role of <see cref="ChatRole.Assistant"/>
/// while another has a role of "AI".
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The relationship between <see cref="ChatCompletion"/> and <see cref="StreamingChatCompletionUpdate"/> is
/// codified in the <see cref="StreamingChatCompletionUpdateExtensions.ToChatCompletionAsync"/> and
/// <see cref="ChatCompletion.ToStreamingChatCompletionUpdates"/>, which enable bidirectional conversions
/// between the two. Note, however, that the conversion may be slightly lossy, for example if multiple updates
/// all have different <see cref="StreamingChatCompletionUpdate.RawRepresentation"/> objects whereas there's
/// only one slot for such an object available in <see cref="ChatCompletion.RawRepresentation"/>.
