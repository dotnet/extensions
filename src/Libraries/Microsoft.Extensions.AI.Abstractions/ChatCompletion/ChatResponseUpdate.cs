/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The relationship between <see cref="ChatResponse"/> and <see cref="ChatResponseUpdate"/> is
/// codified in the <see cref="ChatResponseExtensions.ToChatResponseAsync"/> and
/// <see cref="ChatResponse.ToChatResponseUpdates"/>, which enable bidirectional conversions
/// between the two. Note, however, that the provided conversions may be lossy, for example if multiple
/// updates all have different <see cref="RawRepresentation"/> objects whereas there's only one slot for
/// such an object available in <see cref="ChatResponse.RawRepresentation"/>. Similarly, if different
/// updates provide different values for properties like <see cref="ModelId"/>,
/// only one of the values will be used to populate <see cref="ChatResponse.ModelId"/>.
