# Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.Common

This package contains common health check implementations. Here are the main features it provides:

Application Lifecycle Health Check
- A provider that's tied to the application's lifecycle based on `IHostApplicationLifetime`
- Emits unhealthy status when the application is not started, stopping, or stopped
- Emits healthy status when the application is started and running

Manual Health Check
- A provider that enables manual control of the application's health
- Emits unhealthy status when `ReportUnhealthy` is called
- Emits healthy status when `ReportHealthy` is called

Telemetry Publisher
- A publisher which emits telemetry (logs and counters) representing the application's health
- Can be configured to log only when unhealthy reports are received

See the [health checks](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/health-checks) documentation for general usage guidance.

## Install the package

From the command-line:

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.Common
```

Or directly in the C# project file:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.Common" Version="[CURRENTVERSION]" />
</ItemGroup>
```

## Usage Example

### Application Lifecycle Health Check

The application's lifecycle health check service can be registered and configured using any of the following API:

```csharp
public static IHealthChecksBuilder AddApplicationLifecycleHealthCheck(this IHealthChecksBuilder builder, params string[] tags)
public static IHealthChecksBuilder AddApplicationLifecycleHealthCheck(this IHealthChecksBuilder builder, IEnumerable<string> tags)
```

For example:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddHealthChecks()
    .AddApplicationLifecycleHealthCheck();

var app = builder.Build();

app.MapHealthChecks("/healthz");

app.Run();
```

### Manual Health Check

The manual health check service can be registered and configured using any of the following API:

```csharp
public static IHealthChecksBuilder AddManualHealthCheck(this IHealthChecksBuilder builder, params string[] tags)
public static IHealthChecksBuilder AddManualHealthCheck(this IHealthChecksBuilder builder, IEnumerable<string> tags)
```

Then you can inject `IManualHealthCheck<>` into your services and call the following methods:

```csharp
public static void ReportHealthy(this IManualHealthCheck manualHealthCheck)
public static void ReportUnhealthy(this IManualHealthCheck manualHealthCheck, string reason)
```

For example:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddHealthChecks()
    .AddManualHealthCheck();

var app = builder.Build();

app.MapHealthChecks("/healthz");

app.Run();

public class MyService
{
    private readonly IManualHealthCheck<MyService> healthCheck;

    // inject IManualHealthCheck<> into your service
    public MyService(IManualHealthCheck<MyService> healthCheck)
    {
        this.healthCheck = healthCheck;
    }

    public void DoSomething()
    {
        // ... do something ...

        if (somethingBadHappened)
        {
            this.healthCheck.ReportUnhealthy("reason");
        }

        this.healthCheck.ReportHealthy();
    }
}
```

### Telemetry Publisher

The telemetry publisher can be registered and configured using any of the following API:

```csharp
public static IServiceCollection AddTelemetryHealthCheckPublisher(this IServiceCollection services)
public static IServiceCollection AddTelemetryHealthCheckPublisher(this IServiceCollection services, IConfigurationSection section)
public static IServiceCollection AddTelemetryHealthCheckPublisher(this IServiceCollection services, Action<TelemetryHealthCheckPublisherOptions> configure)
```

For example:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// register health check services as needed
builder.Services.AddHealthChecks()
    .AddCheck<SampleHealthCheck>("Sample");

// register telemetry publisher
builder.Services.AddTelemetryHealthCheckPublisher();

var app = builder.Build();

app.MapHealthChecks("/healthz");

app.Run();
```
