## About

Abstractions for accessing vector database and similarity search.

## Key Features

This package contains abstract classes and utilities for accessing vector databases. Actual implementations are provided separately in other packages; see https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/ai/vector-stores/overview for more information.

The abstractions in this package expose functionality for:

- Mapping .NET types to a collection (e.g. table) in a vector database, with arbitrary schema support.
- Creating, listing and deleting collections in the database.
- Creating, retrieving, updating and deleting records.
- Similarity search using vector embeddings.
- Filtering records using LINQ filters.
- Hybrid search combining vector similarity and keyword search.
- Built-in embedding generation using `Microsoft.Extensions.AI`.

## How to Use

This package typically isn't referenced directly; it's a transitive dependency of a provider.
