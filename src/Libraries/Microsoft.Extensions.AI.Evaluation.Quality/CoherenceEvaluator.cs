            Coherence of an answer is measured by how well all the sentences fit together and sound naturally as a
            whole. Consider the overall quality of the answer when evaluating coherence.

            Given the question and answer, score the coherence of the answer between one to five stars using the
            following rating scale:
            One star: the answer completely lacks coherence
            Two stars: the answer mostly lacks coherence
            Three stars: the answer is partially coherent
            Four stars: the answer is mostly coherent
            Five stars: the answer has perfect coherency

            The rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3
            or 4 or 5.

            question: What is your favorite indoor activity and why do you enjoy it?

            question: How do you cope with stress in your daily life?
            answer: I usually go for a walk to clear my head. Listening to music helps me relax as well. Stress is a

            question: What can you tell me about climate change and its effects on the environment?
            answer: Climate change has far-reaching effects on the environment. Rising temperatures result in the
            melting of polar ice caps, contributing to sea-level rise. Additionally, more frequent and severe weather
            events, such as hurricanes and heatwaves, can cause disruption to ecosystems and human societies alike.
