                # Definition
                **Groundedness** refers to how faithfully a response adheres to the information provided in the CONTEXT, ensuring that all content is directly supported by the context without introducing unsupported information or omitting critical details. It evaluates the fidelity and precision of the response in relation to the source material.

                  **Response:** The new smartphone model has a smaller display and shorter battery life.

                ## [Groundedness: 3] (Accurate Response with Unsupported Additions)
                **Definition:** The response accurately includes information from the CONTEXT but adds details, opinions, or explanations that are not supported by the provided material.

                **Examples:**
                  **Context:** The company's profits increased by 20% in the last quarter.
