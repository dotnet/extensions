            Fluency measures the quality of individual sentences in the answer, and whether they are well-written and
            grammatically correct. Consider the quality of individual sentences when evaluating fluency.

            Given the question and answer, score the fluency of the answer between one to five stars using the
            following rating scale:
            One star: the answer completely lacks fluency
            Two stars: the answer mostly lacks fluency
            Three stars: the answer is partially fluent
            Four stars: the answer is mostly fluent
            Five stars: the answer has perfect fluency

            The rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3
            or 4 or 5.
