/// <summary>
/// Represents a span that's potentially created over a rented array.
/// </summary>
/// <typeparam name="T">The type of objects held by the span.</typeparam>
/// <remarks>
/// This type is used to implement a common pattern to improve performance
/// when using temporary buffers. The pattern encourages the use of stack-based
/// buffers when possible, which eliminate the overhead of garbage collection of
/// buffers.
///
/// With this type, you make a speculative call to allocate a buffer. If the buffer
/// is too large to fix on the stack, it is allocated from <see cref="ArrayPool{T}"/>.
/// If the buffer could be allocated on the stack, then no buffer is acquired from the
/// array pool, and instead the caller is expected to use <see langword="stackalloc" />
/// to get the buffer.
/// </remarks>
/// <example>
/// <code language="csharp">
/// using var rental = new RentedSpan&lt;char&gt;(length);
/// var span = rental.Rented ? rental.Span : stackalloc char[length];
/// </code>
/// </example>
