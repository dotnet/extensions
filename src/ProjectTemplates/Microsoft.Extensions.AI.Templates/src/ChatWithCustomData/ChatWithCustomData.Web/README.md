# AI Chat with Custom Data

This project is an AI chat application that demonstrates how to chat with custom data using an AI language model. Please note that this template is currently at an early preview stage. If you have feedback, please let us know!

>[!NOTE]
> Before you can run this project you'll need to configure API keys or endpoints to work with the providers you have chosen. See below for the details specific to your choices.

#### ---#if (UseAzure)
### Prerequisites
To use Azure OpenAI or Azure AI Search, you will need an Azure account. If you don't have one already, [create an Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

#### ---#endif
# Configure the AI Model Provider

#### ---#if (IsOpenAI)
## Using OpenAI

To call the OpenAI REST API, you will need an API key. To obtain one, first [create a new OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/signup) or [log in](https://platform.openai.com/login). Next, navigate to the API key page and select "Create new secret key", optionally naming the key. Make sure to save your API key somewhere safe and do not share it with anyone.

#### ---#if (hostIdentifier == "vs")
Configure your API key for this project, using .NET User Secrets:

1. In Visual Studio, right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer and select "Manage User Secrets".
2. This will open a secrets.json file where you can store your API key without them being tracked in source control. Add the following key and value to the file:
   
```json
{
   "OpenAI:Key": "YOUR-API-KEY"
}
```

#### ---#else
From the command line, configure your API key for this project using .NET User Secrets by running the following commands:

```sh
cd <<your-project-directory>>
dotnet user-secrets set OpenAI:Key YOUR-API-KEY
```

#### ---#endif
#### ---#endif
#### ---#if (IsOllama)
## Setting up a local environment using Ollama
This project is configured to use Ollama, an application that allows you to run AI models locally on your workstation. Note: Ollama is an excellent open source product, but it is not maintained by Microsoft.

### 1. Install Ollama
First, download and install Ollama from their [official website](https://www.ollama.com). Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.

### 2. Choose and Install Models
This project uses the `llama3.2` and `all-minilm` language modes. To install these models, use the following commands in your terminal once Ollama has been installed:

```sh
ollama pull llama3.2
ollama pull all-minilm
```

### 3. Learn more about Ollama
Once the models are installed, you can start using them in your application. Refer to the [Ollama documentation](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/README.md) for detailed instructions on how to explore models locally.

#### ---#endif
#### ---#if (IsAzureOpenAI)
## Using Azure OpenAI

To use Azure OpenAI, you will need an Azure account and an Azure OpenAI Service resource. For detailed instructions, see the [Azure OpenAI Service documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource).

### 1. Create an Azure OpenAI Service Resource
[Create an Azure OpenAI Service resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal).

### 2. Deploy the Models
Deploy the `gpt-4o-mini` and `text-embedding-3-small` models to your Azure OpenAI Service resource. When creating those deployments, give them the same names as the models (`gpt-4o-mini` and `text-embedding-3-small`). See the Azure OpenAI documentation to learn how to [Deploy a model](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal#deploy-a-model).

#### ---#if (UseManagedIdentity)
### 3. Configure Azure OpenAI for Keyless Authentication
This template is configured to use keyless authentication (also known as Managed Identity, with Entra ID). In the Azure Portal, when viewing the Azure OpenAI resource you just created, view access control settings and assign yourself the `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` role. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/ai/keyless-connections).
