  <!--
    The Oniguruma package for regex testing has its own Arcade & SDK independent build mechanisms that automatically look for hierarchical Directory.Build.props files.
    Therefore, we have this file here in order to suppress the usage of the global SDK and arcade build system to enable yarn install to pass.

    For context the Oniguruma contains C++ code that's dynamically compiled on install.
