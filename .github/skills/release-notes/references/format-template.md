## Section rules

1. **Preamble** — optional. If included, summarize the release theme. For patch releases, if included, name the affected packages. Suggest a couple of options to the user and always offer the option of omitting it.
2. **Packages in this release** — for patch releases only. Table of affected packages and versions. Omit for full releases (all packages ship at the same version).
3. **Breaking Changes** — only for stable API breaks (very rare). Omit if none.
4. **Experimental API Changes** — omit if no experimental changes. Omit empty subsections within.
5. **What's Changed** — grouped by area. Order areas by activity (most entries first). Omit areas with no entries.
6. **Documentation Updates** — flat list. Omit if none.
7. **Test Improvements** — flat list. Omit if none.
8. **Repository Infrastructure Updates** — flat list. Omit if none.
9. **Acknowledgements** — always include. Omit empty sub-items.
10. **Full Changelog** — always last. Link to the GitHub compare view.

## PR and issue references

Use the format `#number` for PRs and issues in the same repository. GitHub will auto-link these in release notes. Use full markdown links only for cross-repo references:

- ✅ `#7380` (same repo — GitHub auto-links)
- ✅ `[dotnet/runtime#124264](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/124264)` (cross-repo)
- ❌ `[#7380](https://github.com/dotnet/extensions/pull/7380)` (unnecessary — same repo)
