# Historical Releases

Mapping of OpenTelemetry semantic-conventions releases with gen-ai changes to dotnet/extensions PRs.

> **Note**: This file is a point-in-time reference and is not intended to be kept up to date with every new release. It provides context for how past convention updates were handled. For the latest release history, consult the [semantic-conventions releases page](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/releases) and search the dotnet/extensions PR history.

## Release History

### Pre-v1.31 (Pre-release Era)

| Convention Version | dotnet/extensions PR | Description |

### v1.31–v1.40 (Stable Release Era)

| v1.37 | [#6767](https://github.com/dotnet/extensions/pull/6767) | Update to v1.37 conventions |

| v1.40 | [#7322](https://github.com/dotnet/extensions/pull/7322) | Update to v1.40 conventions (CCA audit) |

### Feature-Specific PRs (v1.38–v1.40 era)

These PRs implemented specific gen-ai convention features rather than being tied to a single version bump:

| PR | Feature | Convention Source |
|----|---------|-------------------|
| [#7240](https://github.com/dotnet/extensions/pull/7240) | Server-side tool call attributes | v1.37+ |
| [#7241](https://github.com/dotnet/extensions/pull/7241) | Metric computation fix | Bug fix |
| [#7325](https://github.com/dotnet/extensions/pull/7325) | Streaming metrics (time_to_first_chunk, time_per_output_chunk) | v1.39 |
| [#7379](https://github.com/dotnet/extensions/pull/7379) | Exception event recording (gen_ai.client.operation.exception) | v1.40 |
| [#7382](https://github.com/dotnet/extensions/pull/7382) | invoke_workflow operation name | v1.40 |

## Typical Change Patterns by Release

### Version-only releases (v1.36, v1.39)
- Only doc comment version bump needed
- Minimal code changes
- Quick turnaround

### Attribute addition releases (v1.31, v1.34, v1.35, v1.37, v1.38)
- New constants in `OpenTelemetryConsts.cs`
- New attribute emission in one or more OpenTelemetry* clients
- Test updates
- Version bump

### Behavioral change releases (v1.40 features)
- New code patterns (exception recording, streaming metrics)
- May require shared infrastructure (`Common/` classes)
- More extensive test changes
- Often split into multiple PRs per feature
