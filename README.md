# Enriched Capabilities

This repository contains a suite of libraries that provide facilities commonly needed when creating production-ready applications. Initially developed to support high-scale and high-availability services within Microsoft, such as Microsoft Teams, these libraries deliver functionality that can help make applications more efficient, more robust, and more manageable.

The major functional areas this repo addresses are:
- Compliance: Mechanisms to help manage application data according to privacy regulations and policies, which includes a data annotation framework, audit report generation, and telemetry redaction.
- Diagnostics: Provides a set of APIs that can be used to gather and report diagnostic information about the health of a service.
- Contextual Options: Extends the .NET Options model to enable experimentations in production.
- Resilience: Builds on top of the popular Polly library to provide sophisticated resilience pipelines to make applications robust to transient errors.
- Telemetry: Sophisticated telemetry facilities provide enhanced logging, metering, tracing, and latency measuring functionality.
- AspNetCore extensions: Provides different middlewares and extensions that can be used to build high-performance and high-availability ASP.NET Core services.
- Static Analysis: Curated static analysis settings to help improve your code.
- Testing: Dramatically simplifies testing around common .NET abstractions such as ILogger and the TimeProvider.
