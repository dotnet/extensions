      Title: Methods and properties should be named in PascalCase
      Description: Shared naming conventions allow teams to collaborate efficiently. This rule checks whether or not method and property names are PascalCased. To reduce noise, two consecutive upper case characters are allowed unless they form the whole name. So, MyXMethod is compliant, but XM on its own is not.

      Title: Method overrides should not change parameter defaults
      Description: Default arguments are determined by the static type of the object. If a default argument is different for a parameter in an overriding method, the value used in the call will be different when calls are made via the base or derived object, which may be contrary to developer expectations.

      Title: Files should not have too many lines of code
      Description: A source file that grows too much tends to aggregate too many responsibilities and inevitably becomes harder to understand and therefore to maintain. Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor it into smaller pieces of code which focus on well defined tasks. Those smaller files will not only be easier to understand but also probably easier to test.

      Category: Blocker Bug

      Description: If Finalize or an override of Finalize throws an exception, and the runtime is not hosted by an application that overrides the default policy, the runtime terminates the process immediately without graceful cleanup (finally blocks and finalizers are not executed). This behavior ensures process integrity if the finalizer cannot free or destroy resources.

      Title: Inheritance tree of classes should not be too deep
      Description: Inheritance is certainly one of the most valuable concepts in object-oriented programming. It’s a way to compartmentalize and reuse code by creating collections of attributes and behaviors called classes which can be based on previously created classes. But abusing this concept by creating a deep inheritance tree can lead to very complex and unmaintainable source code. Most of the time a too deep inheritance tree is due to bad object oriented design which has led to systematically use 'inheritance' when for instance 'composition' would suit better.

      Title: Overriding members should do more than simply call the same member in the base class
      Description: Overriding a method just to call the same method from the base class without performing any other actions is useless and misleading. The only time this is justified is in sealed overriding methods, where the effect is to lock in the parent class behavior. This rule ignores overrides of Equals and GetHashCode.

The operators can be overloaded, and therefore the comparison can resolve to the appropriate method. However, when the operators are used on interface instances, then == resolves to reference equality, which may result in unexpected behavior if implementing classes override Equals. Similarly, when a class overrides Equals, but instances are compared with non-overloaded ==, there is a high chance that value comparison was meant instead of the reference one.

      Title: Loops with at most one iteration should be refactored
      Description: A loop with at most one iteration is equivalent to the use of an if statement to conditionally execute one piece of code. If the initial intention of the author was really to conditionally execute one piece of code, an if statement should be used instead. If that was not the initial intention of the author, the body of the loop should be fixed to use the nested return, break or throw statements in a more appropriate way.

      Title: Parameters should be passed in the correct order
      Description: When the names of parameters in a method call match the names of the method arguments, it contributes to clearer, more readable code. However, when the names match, but are passed in a different order than the method arguments, it indicates a mistake in the parameter order which will likely lead to unexpected results.

      Title: Multiple "OrderBy" calls should not be used
      Description: There’s no point in chaining multiple OrderBy calls in a LINQ; only the last one will be reflected in the result because each subsequent call completely reorders the list. Thus, calling OrderBy multiple times is a performance issue as well, because all of the sorting will be executed, but only the result of the last sort will be kept.

The foreach statements allows you to downcast elements of a collection of Objects to any other type.

As a majority of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks target the theft of session-cookies, the HttpOnly attribute can help to reduce their impact as it won’t be possible to exploit the XSS vulnerability to steal session-cookies.

      Description: object.Equals() overrides can be optimized by checking first for reference equality between this and the parameter. This check can be implemented by calling object.ReferenceEquals() or base.Equals(), where base is object. However, using base.Equals() is a maintenance hazard because while it works if you extend Object directly, if you introduce a new base class that overrides Equals, it suddenly stops working.

      Title: Exception constructors should not throw exceptions
      Description: It may be a good idea to raise an exception in a constructor if you're unable to fully flesh the object in question, but not in an exception constructor. If you do, you'll interfere with the exception that was originally being thrown. Further, it is highly unlikely that an exception raised in the creation of an exception will be properly handled in the calling code, and the unexpected, unhandled exception will lead to program termination.

That’s as opposed to the NotSupportedException which is thrown by methods which are required by base classes or interfaces, but which are not appropriate to the current class.

If the argument was a value type, the method will be able to change the argument’s values. If it was a reference type, then the method receives a pointer to a pointer, which is usually not what was intended. Even when it is what was intended, this is the sort of thing that’s difficult to get right, and should be used with caution.

However, when applied to collections or arrays, that’s only partly true. readonly enforces that another instance can’t be assigned to the field, but it cannot keep the contents from being updated. That means that in practice, the field value really can be changed, and the use of readonly on such a field is misleading, and you’re likely to not be getting the behavior you expect.

      Description: Native methods are functions that reside in libraries outside the .NET runtime. Calling them is helpful for interoperability with applications and libraries written in other programming languages, mainly when performing platform-specific operations. However, doing so comes with additional risks since it means stepping out of the memory-safety model of the runtime. It is therefore highly recommended to take extra steps, like input validation, when invoking native methods. Making the native method private and providing a wrapper that performs these additional steps is the best way to do so.

A successful attack can result in other files being accessed, modified, corrupted or deleted. This risk is even higher if the application run with elevated permissions.'

Managing and storing data/state between requests can lead to inconsistencies. If, for any reason, you need to have a stateful function, consider using the Durable Functions extension of Azure Functions.
